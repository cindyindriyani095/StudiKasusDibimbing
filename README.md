# Breast Cancer Classification Project - Machine Learning

## Variables:
1. ID number
2. Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
   
## Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3. perimeter
4. area
5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9. symmetry
10. fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

## Goals
1. Classify breast cancer tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) using machine learning.
2. Identify key features influencing the classification (e.g., radius, texture, concavity).
3. Achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliability.
4. Compare machine learning algorithms and optimize performance.

## Insight
1. Features like concavity, compactness, and concave points may strongly correlate with malignant tumors.
2. Address class imbalance to avoid biased predictions.
3. Model interpretability is crucial for real-world medical use.
